Patrick Hoerrle :

Teamwork has been divided up by deliverables and then once our designated pieces are finished they are uploaded for the other members to look over and add and change anything that requires it.
Defined equipment and technician. created use case diagrams and the outline for each. created initial draft of the class diagram. worked on figuring out relationships between classes. The whole system has been evolving over time, once diagrams started to be finished and refined it really helped to draw a clearer picture on how the systems interacts with one another and how the user will interact with the system.
