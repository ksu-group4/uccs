Everyone needs to comment here for one of the deliverables.

Nicholas Terra

  *Created augmented class diagrams using UML outlining the associations and agrregations as well as any inherited classes.
  *Determined the role of session, conference and presentation class.
  As for group work in general, I think everyone had an idea of how they wanted to contribute andhad no problem in letting others knew what they could and couldn't do.

Patrick Hoerrle :

Teamwork has been divided up by deliverables and then once our designated pieces are finished they are uploaded for the other members to look over and add and change anything that requires it.
Defined equipment and technician. created use case diagrams and the outline for each. created initial draft of the class diagram. worked on figuring out relationships between classes. The whole system has been evolving over time, once diagrams started to be finished and refined it really helped to draw a clearer picture on how the systems interacts with one another and how the user will interact with the system.

Aaron Jordan :

The overall experience of this project is a great activity to learn and actually see the process that takes place to develop software.  For each part of the project our team has distributed the work to each member and then planned on each team member to look over each submitted piece.  
Defined room and administrator and also created the class diagrams.  After each part of the project is completed it becomes a little easier to see how it will all work together.  The use case diagrams and class diagrams really help to visualize how the system will be used for reason it was created.
