*Created augmented class diagram in UML. Outlined the associations and aggregations of the classes as well as inherited classes.
*Was in charge of determining the role of session, conference and presentation. 
As for group work in general, I think everyone had an idea of how they wanted to contribute andhad no problem in letting others knew what they could and couldn't do.

* I like the projects. I wish we had a group meeting before or after the exam in class on thursday before spring break.
